Good afternoon,

This email is to inform you that renewal forms and invoices were sent out for {{{BusinessLicenseApplication.CreatedDate}}}. 

The renewal process is automated from our database and was sent only to the main contact listed in our database. If you did not receive the automated email containing the renewal form and invoice, we kindly ask that you check with your main contact and/or in your junk folders. 

If you still are unable to locate the renewal notification email, please send an email to hlth.assistedlivingregistry@gov.bc.ca with the subject “Missing Renewal”, including the name of the residence(s), and we will be happy to assist you.  

If you have any other questions about the renewal process, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you,

Assisted Living Registry
